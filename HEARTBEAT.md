# Heartbeat Checklist

## Every Check (runs every 15 min)

### 1. Cron Job Health
- Check `cron/state.json` for jobs with `consecutive_errors >= 3` or `last_status` containing ERROR
- Alert if any enabled job has been failing repeatedly
- **Staleness check (required — the above is blind without it):** for each enabled job, derive the
  **last expected fire time** from `cron/jobs.json` (per-job cron expression + timezone; interval
  jobs use the interval). Alert only if `last_run` predates that slot by a full extra cycle.
  A job dropped by `misfire_grace_time` never runs, never errors, and keeps `last_status: OK`
  forever — `OK` plus staleness is a *broken health signal*, not a healthy job. Resolve schedules
  from `cron/jobs.json` (per-job timezones), never from prior heartbeat prose.
- **Do NOT compare `now - last_run` against a nominal interval** (this checklist said "alert if > 2x
  the interval" until 2026-08-07 00:23Z — it was wrong). Cron jobs with designed overnight gaps fail
  that test every night: `vidnotes-alerts` (`0 7-23/2` Warsaw) is dark 23:00→07:00 Warsaw = 8h = 4x
  its 2h interval, and `cleanpro-alerts` (`0 8-22/2` Saigon) is dark 22:00→08:00 Saigon = 10h = 5x.
  A 2x rule false-alarms 4h and 6h per night respectively. Schedule gaps are not staleness.
- **Do this BEFORE the hand-derivation above — dropped slots are NOT silent:**
  `grep "was missed by" /tmp/claude-telegram-bot.err | tail -20`
  APScheduler logs `Run time of job "<name>" was missed by H:MM:SS` for every slot it discards, with a
  timestamp and the job name. **This never appears in `logs/infra.log`** — `bot/logging_setup.py` gives
  `bot.infra` its own handler with `propagate=False`, while `apscheduler.executors.default` goes to the
  ROOT logger → console → launchd's stderr file. That is why cycles up to 2026-08-07 00:41Z believed the
  drops were invisible and rebuilt them by hand from cron expressions + `pmset`. Caveats: (a) the file
  covers the CURRENT bot process only (it starts at process launch; `pgrep`+`ps -o etime` to date it),
  and (b) `coalesce` collapses some consecutive misses, so the warning count is a **lower bound** —
  it reconciled exactly on 08-05 (20 ran + 4 missed = 24) and was one short on 08-06 (18 + 5 = 23).
  Use it to find *which* jobs and *when*; confirm counts against `Running job:` lines in infra.log.
- **The detector LAGS — never use an unchanged `was missed by` count to clear the CURRENT window.**
  APScheduler writes the warning when the executor NEXT evaluates that job, which can be longer than
  one heartbeat interval. On 2026-08-07 05:03Z three slots (vidnotes-daily + vidnotes-alerts 12:00
  ICT, echo-backend-alerts 12:05 ICT) were already irrecoverably dropped while the count sat at 49.
  For "did anything drop just now", check `Running job:` lines + `last_run` against the derived slot.
  Bonus: a host-sleep window is datable from your own Bash calls — a >1 min gap between consecutive
  tool returns is the machine asleep, and it matches the `getUpdates` polling gap in `.err` exactly.
- Known open defect (reported 2026-08-07, needs a bot restart = boss's call): `CronTrigger.from_crontab`
  in `bot/scheduler.py` does not remap crontab dow (0=Sun) to APScheduler dow (0=Mon), so every
  weekly job fires one day late. Don't re-report it as new; check `memory/t0/MEMORY.md` first.
- `coalesce=True` is ALREADY in effect (APScheduler 3.11.3 default; verified in `.venv` —
  `job_defaults -> {'misfire_grace_time': 300, 'coalesce': True, 'max_instances': 1}`). Don't propose
  it as a fix; only raising `misfire_grace_time` at `bot/scheduler.py:24` is a real change.

### 2. Bot Health
- Check if the Telegram bot process is running: `pgrep -f "python.*-m bot"`
- Check `/tmp/claude-telegram-bot.err` for recent errors (last 5 min)
- Alert if bot is down or throwing repeated errors

### 3. Memory & Reminders
- **Read memory FIRST, before drafting any alert** — otherwise known issues get re-reported as new discoveries
- Read `memory/t0/MEMORY.md` (repo root) for pending tasks or reminders
- Check today's daily logs at `memory/t0/{YYYY-MM-DD}/` for context on what's been done
- **Path warning:** `workspaces/c352342178/memory/` is a STALE duplicate tree. Never read or write it.
  Heartbeat logs go to `memory/t0/{YYYY-MM-DD}/heartbeat-{HHMM}z.md` at the repo root.

### 4. Infra Log Anomalies
- Read last 20 lines of `logs/infra.log`
- Check for repeated `resp=0` or `resp=66` (stuck/failed sessions)
- **DATE these before believing them (2026-08-07 13:47Z): both are DEAD.** Last `resp=0` was
  **2026-07-11**, last `resp=66` **2026-05-15**. A `grep -oE "resp=[0-9]+" | tail | uniq -c` shows
  `2 resp=0 / 4 resp=66` and reads as live — it isn't, those are months-old lines near the tail of a
  file with no rotation. Anchor to the `^2026-` timestamp before alerting.
- Check for lock acquisition timeouts (zero lifetime so far; a bare `grep -i lock` on infra.log
  matches `bot was blocked by the user`, which is unrelated)

## How to Alert
- Send via telegram-sender skill to chat 352342178 (Boss DM)
- Be brief: problem + what you see + suggested action
- **Only send if something needs attention** — silence means healthy

## What NOT to do
- Don't check disk space, Downloads folder, or calendar
- Don't send "all clear" messages — silence is the signal for healthy
- Don't restart services — only report issues
