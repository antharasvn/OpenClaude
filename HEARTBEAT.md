# Heartbeat Checklist

## Every Check (runs every 15 min)

### 1. Cron Job Health
- Check `cron/state.json` for jobs with `consecutive_errors >= 3` or `last_status` containing ERROR
- Alert if any enabled job has been failing repeatedly

### 2. Bot Health
- Check if the Telegram bot process is running: `pgrep -f "python.*-m bot"`
- Check `/tmp/claude-telegram-bot.err` for recent errors (last 5 min)
- Alert if bot is down or throwing repeated errors

### 3. Memory & Reminders
- Read workspace memory files under `workspaces/c352342178/memory/` for pending tasks or reminders
- Check today's daily logs for context on what's been done

### 4. Infra Log Anomalies
- Read last 20 lines of `logs/infra.log`
- Check for repeated `resp=0` or `resp=66` (stuck/failed sessions)
- Check for lock acquisition timeouts

## How to Alert
- Send via telegram-sender skill to chat 352342178 (Boss DM)
- Be brief: problem + what you see + suggested action
- **Only send if something needs attention** — silence means healthy

## What NOT to do
- Don't check disk space, Downloads folder, or calendar
- Don't send "all clear" messages — silence is the signal for healthy
- Don't restart services — only report issues
